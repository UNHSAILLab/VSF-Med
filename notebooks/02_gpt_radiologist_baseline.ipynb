It executes the following workflow:\n\n1. Connects to a database to fetch radiological questions\n2. Processes chest X-ray images\n3. Sends the images and questions to the GPT-4o API\n4. Stores responses back in the database for further evaluation\n\n<a href=\"https://colab.research.google.com/github/thedatasense/robust-med-mllm-experiments/blob/main/models/GPT/gpt-radiologist.ipynb\" target=\"_parent\"><img src=\"https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg\" alt=\"Open In Colab\"/></a>",
